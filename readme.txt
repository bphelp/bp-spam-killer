This light weight plugin will help prevent spam registrations 

== Description ==
IMPORTANT INFO: You must create a page with the slug 'spam-prevention' so 
potential spammers recieve a message on their spammy behavior! See Notes for an example message!
Not sure where credit goes too, I got the code on BP Forums and I just packaged the code as a light weight plugin that
will help prevent spam registrations. If the original author would like credit please contact me on github and I will add you.

== Installation ==

Install and activate the plugin and kiss spam registrations goodbye!

== Screenshots ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

None at the moment

== Notes ==

Below is an example message to put in a page with the slug spam-prevention:

If you’re seeing this page, you’ve done something that looks a little spammy.

It could be that you simply haven’t got JavaScript or cookies enabled. 
If that’s that case, then should you know how to turn it back on for our site, 
or else you might need a better or more recent browser :-) 

Spammers like to use automated software and lots of other tricks to bypass the
very techniques we use to make sure only our members and other, legitimate folk 
are using our site.

If you are a real person and / or a legitimate member, then we apologise for the 
inconvenience and invite you to contact us so that we can get you sorted as soon 
as possible :-)
